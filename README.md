# Facial-Authenticity-Recognition-System

Overview

This project explores the use of deep learning techniques to generate high-quality face images and perform facial biometric recognition using multimodal approaches. It leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) alongside facial biometric features to enhance image realism and ensure accurate identity preservation across multiple modes of data.

Key Features

Multimodal Face Generation: Utilizes GANs to generate realistic face images conditioned on various attributes such as age, gender, and ethnicity.
Facial Biometrics Recognition: Integrates biometric feature extraction for face identification and verification using deep learning models.
Data Augmentation: Includes various techniques to improve the robustness and generalization of face generation and recognition models.
Model Training: Combines pre-trained models with custom layers for efficient multimodal learning.
Technologies Used
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): For face generation.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): For facial recognition and feature extraction.
PyTorch: As the primary deep learning framework.
